Original requirements:
1. When pressing enter at the end of a line, a pop up should appear
2. The pop up contains a list of possible nodes to be inserted at that stage
3. The pop up list have a default highlighted node that you can select by pressing enter again
4. You can navigate the list with the arrow keys
5. When you select a node, it is inserted at the new line after the cursor


Current state:
1. When pressing enter at the end of a line, a pop up appears
2. The list of possible nodes is not correct
  2.1 The list showing next possible nodes is not okay
3. The pop up have a default selected node that you can select by pressing enter again
4. You can navigate the list with the arrow keys
5. When you select a node, it is inserted at the new line after the cursor but it's still broken


TODO:
2. Fix the insertion of the selected node
